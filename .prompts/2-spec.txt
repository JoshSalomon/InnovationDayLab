I want to build web app that handles tasks. It shows the tasks (each one has fields such as description, due-date, status, progress etc.). Task have dependencies so the app should be able to edis and show dependencies. circular dependencies are not allowed. This is a multi user application, each user sees only his own tasks. the app starts with a single admin user which is the only user which can craete additional users to the app - this is the only thing admin can do. 
non admin users can create, edit and delete tasks (delete requires a dialog with option to cancel).
Tasks can be filtered in multiple ways, but the most important fileters are 'all', 'completed' and 'in progress' (meaning all that are not completed). there is no way for a user to see the tasks of another user. The UI should be simple and intuitive.
Tasks should persist between invications of the server
On the next phase I would like to add Rest API to the server, with 2 APIs, login and get_tasks. No need to add APIs for editing tasks.
